# Buttons

Use the button component inside forms, as links, social login, payment options with support for multiple styles, colors, sizes, gradients, and shadows. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The button component is probably the most widely used element in any user interface or website as it can be used to launch an action but also to link to other pages.

Opera8 provides a large variety of styles and sizes for the button component including outlined buttons, multiple colors, sizes, buttons with icons, and more.

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Protocol API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
```

```js
import ApiClient from '@example/protocol-api'

const client = new ApiClient(token)

await client.conversations.list()
```

```python
from protocol_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.conversations.list()
```

```php
$client = new \Protocol\ApiClient($token);

$client->conversations->list();
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/conversations"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint"
  />
</div>
